	depends on USB
	help
	  Bluetooth HCI USB driver.
	  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth devices with
	  USB interface.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth USB devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (btusb).

config BT_HCIBTSDIO
	tristate "HCI SDIO driver"
	depends on MMC
	help
	  Bluetooth HCI SDIO driver.
	  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth device with
	  SDIO interface.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth SDIO devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (btsdio).

config BT_HCIUART
	tristate "HCI UART driver"
	help
	  Bluetooth HCI UART driver.
	  This driver is required if you want to use Bluetooth devices with
	  serial port interface. You will also need this driver if you have 
	  UART based Bluetooth PCMCIA and CF devices like Xircom Credit Card 
	  adapter and BrainBoxes Bluetooth PC Card.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Bluetooth UART devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_uart).

config BT_HCIUART_H4
	bool "UART (H4) protocol support"
	depends on BT_HCIUART
	help
	  UART (H4) is serial protocol for communication between Bluetooth 
	  device and host. This protocol is required for most Bluetooth devices 
	  with UART interface, including PCMCIA and CF cards. 

	  Say Y here to compile support for HCI UART (H4) protocol.

config BT_HCIUART_BCSP
	bool "BCSP protocol support"
	depends on BT_HCIUART
	select BITREVERSE
	help
	  BCSP (BlueCore Serial Protocol) is serial protocol for communication 
	  between Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for non
	  USB Bluetooth devices based on CSR BlueCore chip, including PCMCIA and
	  CF cards.

	  Say Y here to compile support for HCI BCSP protocol.

config BT_HCIUART_LL
	bool "HCILL protocol support"
	depends on BT_HCIUART
	help
	  HCILL (HCI Low Level) is a serial protocol for communication
	  between Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for
	  serial Bluetooth devices that are based on Texas Instruments'
	  BRF chips.

	  Say Y here to compile support for HCILL protocol.

config BT_HCIUART_IBS
	bool "HCI_IBS protocol support"
	depends on BT_HCIUART
	default n
	help
	  HCI_IBS (HCI In-Band Sleep) is a serial protocol for communication
	  between Bluetooth device and host. This protocol is required for
	  UART clock control for some Qualcomm Bluetooth devices.

	  Say Y here to compile support for HCI_IBS protocol.

config BT_MSM_SLEEP
	tristate "MSM Bluesleep driver"
	depends on BT && SERIAL_MSM_HS
	default n
	help
	  Bluetooth MSM bluesleep driver.
	  This driver provides support for BTS sleep.

config BT_BCM_SLEEP
	tristate "MSM Broadcomm Bluesleep driver"
	depends on BT && SERIAL_MSM_HS
	default n
	help
	  Bluetooth BCM bluesleep driver.
	  This driver provides support for BCM sleep.
	  
config BT_BCM_BTLA_SLEEP
	tristate "MSM Broadcomm BTLA Bluesleep driver"
	depends on BT && SERIAL_MSM_HS
	default n
	help
	  Bluetooth BCM BTLA bluesleep driver.
	  This driver provides support for BCM BTLA sleep.

config BT_HCIVHCI
	tristate "HCI VHCI (Virtual HCI device) driver"
	help
	  Bluetooth Virtual HCI device driver.
	  This driver is required if you want to use HCI Emulation software.

	  Say Y here to compile support for virtual HCI devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_vhci).

config MSM_BT_POWER
	tristate "MSM Bluetooth Power Control"
	depends on ARCH_MSM && RFKILL
	default m
	help
	  Provides a parameter to switch on/off power from PMIC
	  to Bluetooth device.
	  
config MSM_BCM_POWER
	tristate "MSM BCM Power Control"
	depends on ARCH_MSM && RFKILL
	default m
	help
	  Provides a parameter to switch on/off power from PMIC
	  to BCM device.

config BT_ATH3K
	tristate "Atheros firmware download driver"
	depends on BT_HCIBTUSB
	select FW_LOADER
	help
	  Bluetooth firmware download driver.
	  This driver loads the firmware into the Atheros Bluetooth
	  chipset.

	  Say Y here to compile support for "Atheros firmware download driver"
	  into the kernel or say M to compile it as module (ath3k).
